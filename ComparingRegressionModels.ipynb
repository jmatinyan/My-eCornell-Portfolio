    "\n",
    "So far, we have mostly focused on classification problems. For this assignment, we will focus on a regression problem and predict a continuous outcome. There are different evaluation metrics that are used to determine the performance of a regressor. We will use two metrics to evaluate our regressors: RMSE (root mean square error) and $R^2$ (coefficient of determination).\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE:<br>\n",
    "RMSE finds the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. We will compute the RMSE on the test set.  To compute the RMSE, we will use the scikit-learn ```mean_squared_error()``` function. Since RMSE finds the difference between the predicted and actual values, lower RMSE values indicate good performance - the model fits the data well and makes more accurate predictions. On the other hand, higher RSME values indicate that the model is not performing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$:<br>\n",
    "$R^2$ is a measure of the proportion of variability in the prediction that the model was able to make using the test data. An $R^2$ value of 1 is perfect and 0 implies no explanatory value. We can use scikit-learn's ```r2_score()``` function to compute it. Since $R^2$ measures how well the model fits the data, a higher $R^2$ value indicates that good performance and a lower $R^2$ indicates that poor performance.\n",
